A simplified Android `Player` wrapper for [MediaPlayer](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/MediaPlayer.html) and [ExoPlayer](https://google.github.io/ExoPlayer/).

## Description

Some of the benefits are:

- Unified playback interface and event listeners for ExoPlayer and MediaPlayer
- `MediaPlayer` buffering
- `ExoPlayer` local, streaming and provisioning WideVine Modular DRM
- Maintains video Aspect Ratio by default
- Player selection based on `ContentType` and DRM

## Adding to your project

To start using this library, add these lines to the `build.gradle` of your project:

```groovy
repositories {
    jcenter()
}

dependencies {
    compile 'com.novoda:no-player:<latest-version>'
}
```
### Simple usage

 1. Create a `Player`:

    ```java
    Player player = new PlayerBuilder()
      .withPriority(PlayerType.EXO_PLAYER)
      .withWidevineModularStreamingDrm(drmHandler)
      .build(this);
    ```

 2. Create the `PlayerView`:
  
    ```xml
    <com.novoda.noplayer.NoPlayerView
      android:id="@+id/player_view"
      android:layout_width="wrap_content"
      android:layout_height="wrap_content"
      android:layout_gravity="center" />
    ```

 3. Attach to a `PlayerView`:

    ```java
    PlayerView playerView = findViewById(R.id.player_view);
    player.attach(playerView);
    ```


 4. Play some content:

    ```java
    player.getListeners().addPreparedListener(playerState -> player.play());
    
    Uri uri = Uri.parse(mpdUrl);
    player.loadVideo(uri, ContentType.DASH);
    ```

Snapshot builds from [`develop`](https://github.com/novoda/no-player/compare/master...develop) are automatically deployed to a [repository](https://bintray.com/novoda/snapshots/no-player/_latestVersion) that is not synced with JCenter.
To consume a snapshot build add an additional maven repo as follows:
```
repositories {
    maven {
        url 'https://novoda.bintray.com/snapshots'
    }
}
```
